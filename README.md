# StarlightLagger

Lags the lobby with invalid objects, bypasses safety settings, and eventually crashes everyone.

# Reason

So I used to have this in my paid client, but due to some users getting god complexes I now want this exploit patched. Sending code to the devs is tantamount to keeping it private, so in order for them to actually care I have to release it and make everyone abuse it so they will consider patching it. I find it egregious how apathetic the Devs are for this game seriously fire them. Sorry for the destruction this will cause.

# Credits
Me and Sypherr found this exploit
